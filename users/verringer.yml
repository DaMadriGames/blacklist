reasons:
- Never pays back what he borrowed. (He bought a theme using my money, http://i.imgur.com/aWPR8No.png)
- Lies to communities time and time again, http://i.imgur.com/6DVzo6N.png (Of course, mc-market always stays up...)
- http://i.imgur.com/izgf62j.png (He says this whilst administrating his site and saying staff are doing a great job)
- Said I was the one who DDoSed mc-market... http://i.imgur.com/1R8VPym.png
- Inexperienced http://i.imgur.com/9lsuJpt.png
- Claims to be a web developer but cannot design basic buttons, he's now changed his website
- Is highly inexperienced with servers, http://i.imgur.com/9lsuJpt.png is just... yeah.
- Claims to be a "xenForo specialist" but has a many problems with it http://i.imgur.com/naylk1N.png
- Threatens to get his own way, this shouldn't really be a quality people want in a site owner: http://i.imgur.com/PaipncH.png
- Talks down to people http://i.imgur.com/FDskMIg.png (I wasn't the one who asked the question in the image)
- Is almost totally incapable of using CloudFlare, in fact DNS in gneneral (MC-Market's downtime plus the fact it took him 5 hours with help to actually setup a new page rule)
